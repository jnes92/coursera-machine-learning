# Week 1 - Yann LeCun 

personal story
- interested in intelligence (general)
- technology, space and human evolution
- studied electrical engineering
- philosophy books: debate between nature and nurture
- perceptron
- field disappeared 1960-1980
- experimenting with simulation software
- after studies, chip design
- neocognitron: similiar to cnn without backprop like learning
- field more interesting for psychology phiscian, not engineers or computer science
- Geoff Hinton and Terry Sejnowski: Boltzmann machines
- started PhD
- takling with Bell Labs about his way of backprop
- independently reinvented backprop
- started at bell labs
- at Bell Labs you dont get famous by saving money
- build interpreter, own code (no python, etc.)
- first halfe neural net, partially atomic machinery
- at&t splitted, patent to different company till 2007
- ai winter, but hope was not gone
- D-J-V-U : compress scanned document to distribute papers over the internet

cnn process
- always believed that this was gonna work
- some continous progress as machines got more powerful
- interest for neural net died in 95-2002 
- several people got similiar ideas
- interest picked up really fast imagenet (2012)
- most cv people had no idea was a cnn is ?

today: NYU, FAIR (Facebook AI Research)
how corporate research should be done ?
- freedom to setup FAIR like he wants
- first research organization
- fb focused on survival
- thinking about next 10 years
- survival not in question
- started to transition
- explored serval ways on how to build an effort in ai
- hiring new / acquiring company / senior setting up
- research need to be open
- encouriage to publish
- evaluated on similiar scale like academic researcher
- distribute open source, open company
- Mike Schroepfer was CTO (before Mozilla Open Source)
- dna of facebook: open?
- stay behind scenes

advice for ai beginners:
- easy to get involved at some level
- cheap bedroom computer is enough to train whatever
- online material
- make yourself useful
- contribute to open source
- implement some code you cant find online
- take a paper reimplement algorithm, put it open source, contribute to framework
- if its useful, you will get noticed
