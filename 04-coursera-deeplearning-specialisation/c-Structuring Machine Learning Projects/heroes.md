# Heroes of Deep Learning - Part 3

## Week 1 - Andrej Karpathy

personal story:
- undergraduate in university
- liked the idea of mind of the network
- sth magical happening on lots of digits
- masters degree: deeper into networks
- very interesting, but not satisfying courses
- machine learning like technical term
- neural networks seems like the ai
- new computing paradise
- in-out specification can sometimes write better code than you
- new way of programming

human benchmark for imagenet:
- world cup of cv
- error rate goes down
- where is a human on this scale ?
- lowest error by humans like 6-10% baseline
- js interface showing images, with 1000 categories
- fun exercise
- organize other ppl to do the same thing (1-2 weeks)
- surprised by software deep networks surpassing you

dl class:
- research on hold
- highlight of PhD, class
- exciting students
- taught things from 1800
- paper from yesterday or week ago
- enjoyable, understood everything that happens under the hood
- forefront of sth big

evolve understanding of dl:
- cnn were around, but not used often or soon
- just for small cases, but never scales
- extreme incorrect
- no one saw coming: pre-trained network, fine tuning on other 
- general feature extractor 
- crushing each task by fine-tuning network
- hopes of unsupervised learning (2007) not delivered
- supervised learning works really well right now
- lot of deep believers for unsupervised learning

future of ai:
- openAI
- field will split into 2 categories
- applied ai: getting better, using
- artificial general intelligence: nn that can do everything a human can do
- cv was approached wrong in the beginning: breaking into parts, putting it together
- similiar on a higher level on ai
- try to decompose it again, same incorrect approach
- having a single nn, a full agent:
- esssay, short story: hypotheoretical https://karpathy.github.io/2015/11/14/ai
- imitate humans and other directions


advice for new ai:
- down to low level code
- implement chunks of it by yourself
- dont abstract, do things from scratch
- work with frameworks, after you have done it once yourself
